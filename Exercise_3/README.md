# Exercise 3
   **Development Board used: NVIDIA's Jetson Nano**
   
   **Tools used: Gcc Compiler, Vim editor, MobaXterm**
   
   **Note**: Before executing any of the codes in Exercise 3, run 'myscript.sh'. Linux dynamically scales CPU clock
    speed and can disable cores. This adds a non-deterministic behavior to the FIFO threads, which can be a potential
    problem for the assignments in this course. In order to avoid these issues, execute the script by using the           command "sh myscript.sh" from your **root directory** (to get to root directory, type "**sudo su**" from your         present directory) on Linux. 
    These configurations are temporary. This means that you'll have to run the script each time you reboot the           system.
