**Development Board used: NVIDIA's Jetson Nano**

**Tools used: Gcc Compiler, Vim editor, LogiTech C615 webcam**

**Note**: Before executing the code for the final project, run 'myscript.sh'. Linux dynamically scales CPU clock speed and can disable cores. This adds a non-deterministic behavior to the FIFO threads, which can be a potential problem for the assignments and projects in this course. In order to avoid these issues, execute the script by using the command "sh myscript.sh" from your root directory (to get to root directory, type "sudo su" from your present directory) on Linux. These configurations are temporary. This means that you'll have to run the script each time you reboot the system
